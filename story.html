    <h2>about us</h2>
    <p>We met in Boston on one of our first days in optometry school. We cliqued right away and shared a close-knit circle of friends. Nick spent the next few years sitting in the back of the lecture hall playing games on his phone, while Steph was buried in highlighters at the library.  Outside of school, we grew close as friends on countless fun adventures in Boston and beyond.</p>
    <p>It wasnâ€™t until our last year of school that we realized the relationship that we had built was deeper than friendship. We started dating long distance as Steph travelled to Vermont and New Mexico on her clinical rotations. This made for some exciting explorations together in new parts of the country, and the explorations continued with a post-graduation trip to Asia and Hawaii. The next year was spent apart, with Steph living in Seattle and Nick in Northern California. During this year, the distance was eased with a proposal to remember at Yosemite National Park. After many weekend visits and hundreds of FaceTime hours, Steph finally joined Nick in California where the adventures continue.</p>

    <h2>engagement</h2>
    <p>Despite the raging wildfires, we decided to continue with our Yosemite camping trip as planned Labor Day weekend of 2013. Nick had imagined a picturesque backdrop around every turn for the perfect proposal. However, we found the park full of smoke and ash. Just as Nick was beginning to lose hope of finding that perfect spot, we found ourselves at the base of Vernal Falls. He handed off the camera to a young girl for a photo of the two of us and tipped her off to his plans. While not as Nick had imagined, the smoky skies and ash-covered backpacks made it all the more memorable.</p>
